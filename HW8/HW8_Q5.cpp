/* 

Assignment:
-----------

Write a program that reads a personâ€™s name in the following format:
first name, then middle name or initial, and then last name.

The program then outputs the name in the following format:
Last_Name, First_Name Middle_Initial.

For example, the input Mary Average User
should produce the output: User, Mary A.

The input Mary A.User should also produce the output: User, Mary A.

Note that your program should work the same
and place a period after the middle initial
even if the input did not contain a period.

Hint: You may want to use three string variables
rather than one large string variable for the input.
You may find it easier to not use getline.
