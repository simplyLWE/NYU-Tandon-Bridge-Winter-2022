The number e is an important mathematical constant that is the base of the natural logarithm.
e also arises in the study of compound interest, and in many other applications.

Background of e: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)

e can be calculated as the sum of the infinite series: e = 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + 1/4! + ...

The value of e is approximately equal to 2.71828.
We can get an approximate value of e, by calculating only a partial sum of the infinite sum above (the more addends we add, the better approximation we get).

Implement the function:
double eApprox(int n)

This function is given a positive integer n, and returns an approximation of e, calculated by the sum of the first (n+1) addends of the infinite sum above.

To test your function use the following main:

int main() {
  cout.precision(30);

  for (int n = 1; n <= 15; n++) {
    cout << "n = " << n << '\t' << eApprox(n) << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}

Notes:
1. Pay attention to the running time of eApprox. An efficient implementation would run in Î˜(n).
2. Since the values of the factorials will grow to be very large, use a variable of type double to store them.
